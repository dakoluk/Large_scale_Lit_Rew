**Friendly Literature Review Helper**: Hey there, fellow researchers! ðŸŒŸ I've put together this little toolkit because, like many of you, I found myself wading through massive .ris files trying to get a handle on my literature review. This is for all of us out there trying to make sense of piles of papers based on publication years, keywords, subject connections, and more - without pulling our hair out!

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find:

- **Yearly Insights**: See how your field has grown over the years.
- **Keyword Magic**: Figure out the major buzzwords and trends.
- **Subject Area Networks**: Discover how different areas link up and interact.
- **Big .RIS File Friendly**: Built especially with huge Zotero exports in mind.

I made this because I needed it, and I thought, why not make research a little easier for everyone else too? ðŸš€

Happy researching,
D. Akoluk
